# PTD1-Server-Code
I am attempting to recreate the PTD1 Server code so a local server can be run and the swf will work fine with just a /etc/hosts change to a different ip.

Thank you to JetBrains support for giving me the Open Source Software license I need to continue to work on this project

(I say need as the alternatives like Eclipse PDT or VS Codium just aren't comparable to IntelliJ PHPStorm
based on my own experiences, and the things they are missing make it tremendously harder to work on php or web related projects)

So again, big thank you to JetBrains support, if you work on open source projects and would like a license to all of
JetBrains' IDEs to assist you on any language or workflow, then you can go to https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport and make a request for a license
